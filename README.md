# Spell-Corrector
A Project that can correct the wrong Spelled Words and provide the best possible correct word based on the probability of most likely to happen

Its a java based spell corrector that can check for words with wrong spelling in a file or sentence and can provide the most possible correct word that user might be tryng to write

This project can be usefull for other spell correction projects. It can work as  better as you want depending upon the knowledge base you provide.It needs a knowledge base with all the autheticated correct spelled words like an article from english newspaper or a novel whose words speeling can be trusted. The larger and better the knowledge base , the better spell correction will be
Knowledge base or sample data is stored in text file under project. I have not spent much time on this code ...so free to make changes and made it better 

Enjoy and
Thanks :D
