# Spell-Corrector

A Code that can correct the wrong Spelled Words and provide the best possible correct word based on the probability of most likely to happen. It is my own implementation





Its a java based spell corrector that can check for words with wrong spelling in a file or sentence and can provide the most possible correct word that user might be tryng to write



This project can be usefull for other spell correction projects. It can work as  better as you want depending upon the knowledge base you provide.It needs a knowledge base with all the autheticated correct spelled words like an article from english newspaper or a novel whose words speeling can be trusted. The larger and better the knowledge base , the better spell correction will be


I have also provided the algorithm for spelling correction which can be developed . Though I have implemented most of it but you can still try to make it work better . Please refer "Shubham-spell-corrector-source.pdf" file that I have provided




Knowledge base or sample data is stored in text file under project. I have not spent much time on this code ...so free to make changes and made it better   

Enjoy
:D
